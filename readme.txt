= It doesn't work on my local WordPress site.
* It doesn't work on many local WordPress sites. We don't know why. On our VVV site, we found that querying the media using custom taxonomies does not return anything. It does work on our server. If you used our custom taxonomies and find that they taxonomies don't work, please install one of the suggested media libraries and move your taxonomies. <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-switcher/'>Taxonomy Switcher</a> is a great plugin for transferring plugins.
